# Dance Dance SACRIFICE

Welcome to our second LDJam entry (and first for our graphic designer Lola)! With one new talent in the team we took the opposite approach from LDJam42. No abstract black-white-grey game this time, we have a colorful and vibrant entry for you all!

## Getting Started
If you just want to play the game, rendezvous on the [itch.io page](https://eviber.itch.io/dance-dance-sacrifices).
Otherwise, run Love2D in the repo.
```
love .
```
### Prerequisites

You will need to install LÖVE to run this game. The best way is to do it from [love2d.org](https://love2d.org/).

## The Game
Your gods demand sacrifices! Not one, not two… but as many as you can make in a week! Using the ancestral ritual of the Great Hand-Free Sacrifice, you shall dance their bidding til they are satisfied. Don’t make the mistake to disappoint them even a single day.

### Controls
Use the Arrow Keys to perform the ritual “No Hands” dance and sacrifice men, women, pets and chickens to appease the divine wrath. Don’t make a wrong step or you’ll have to start from the beginning! Make enough sacrifices each day to avoid punishment.
